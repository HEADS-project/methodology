# Service Operators

The HEADS service operator is responsible for the deployment of the HD-Service and should be able to monitor its execution, adapt it at runtime and deploy new version of the HD-Service components (provided by the HD-Service developer).

The Service operator does not necessarily have detailed knowledge of the HD-Service implementation details or platforms it is running on. It is typically an administrator or a super-user of the HD-Service itself.

The service operator is mainly using Kevoree to accomplish its tasks. The tasks associated with the HEADS Platform Expert are detailed in section XXX.
