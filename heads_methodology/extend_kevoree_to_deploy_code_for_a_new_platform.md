# Extend Kevoree to deploy code for a new platform

HEADS is not specific to any runtime platform. The platform expert is responsible for adding support for deploying code to the platforms. This is done by creating Kevorre node types and implementing the node type API to allow for dynamically deploying and monitoring components on the target platform.

We currently support JVM based platform. See here how you can create you own component build it and deploy it
