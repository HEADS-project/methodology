# Service Operators for CEP
A service operator has to deploy Apama as a CEP engine on 
- cloud-nodes
- Nodes powered by Raspberry Pi 2/3
- Nodes powered by Intel-Atom like Dell Edge devices
In addition, the code written in EPL (Event Processing Language) has to be deployed by injection on these CEP engines. This can be EPL code generated by the CEP Recommender or originally developed by a service developer. If the event processing network contains nodes which are not supported by a CEP engine, C code or similar has to be generated with the HEADS transformation framework for this device.
