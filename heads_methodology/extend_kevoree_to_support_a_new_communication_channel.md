# Extend Kevoree to support a new communication channel

To support different communication protocols, HEADS relies on the definition of communication channels. Kevoree allows defining channel types which can then be deployed between components. The channel types can wrap low level protocols (such as binary on a serial link) as well as high level protocols (such as emails or skype calls).
