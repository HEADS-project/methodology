IDE & Methodology\nThe main result of the HEADS project is the HEADS IDE for HD-Services development. The HEADS IDE and modelling languages are fully released as open-source using non contaminating licenses (such as LGPL or EPL) to allow both proprietary usage and extensions. The HEADS IDE is complemented by this methodology document which\n\nguides developers of HD-Services in using the HEADS techniques and tools and\nguides platform experts to add support for new platforms by developing plugins for the HEADS IDE.\n\nThe objective of the project is not to provide a complete set of plugins covering the whole future internet continuum but a set of selected representative plugins which\n\ndemonstrate the approach,\nmakes it available to third parties and\ncover the needs of the use cases.\n\nA HEADS plugin for a particular platform includes\n\na code generator for the specific platform,\na HEADS model library (API) exposing the capabilities of the platform and\na mechanism for deploying code to the platform.\n\nThe plugins supporting different platforms can be released with different licences. All the generic code generators to general purpose language will be released as open-source. All the plugins developed by the academic partners will be released open-source. Plugins and specialization made by the industry partners and for the use cases might be kept proprietary. Third parties will be provided with the tools and documentation necessary to develop third party plugins.\n"},"heads_actors/":{"url":"heads_actors/","title":"HEADS Actors","keywords":"","body":"HEADS Actors\nThis section introduces and defines the different HEADS actors.\n\nAs we will intensively refer to these actors in the rest of this document, better read this whole section!\n\n"},"heads_actors/platform_experts.html":{"url":"heads_actors/platform_experts.html","title":"Platform Experts","keywords":"","body":"Platform Experts\nThe platform Experts are responsible for creating new plugins for the HEADS IDE in order to support new platform and their specific capabilities.\nThe platform expert can use a number of different extension points in order to support both the design time and the runtime support of a given platform.

These platform specific libraries integrated ThingML structures and code together with code written in the target language and specific to the target platform.\nThis section details how to implement a driver for ThingML. A driver basically wraps an existing piece of code (in Java, C, C++, ...) and exposes it as a ThingML API, which can then be seamlessly used by service designers, with no need to cope with low-level details related to Java, C, C++, ...\nWe will use a simple random integer generator as a running example, that we will wrap in C and also in Java.\n\nGenerating random integers could certainly be implemented directly in ThingML, however, as all programming languages already provide facilities for random generation, this would have been like... re-inventing the wheel. Better wrap what already works!\n\nDefining the interface\nA ThingML driver is a plain ThingML component (or thing). In this respect, it is usually recommended to first describe the interface of a component, and then implement it, possibly for different platforms. This is realized in two steps.\nFirst, declare a thing fragment containing all the messages that are relevant:\nthing fragment RandomMsg{\n    message request();\n    message answer(v: Integer);\n}\n\n\nAs ThingML is asynchronous, the request and the answer should be defined in two distinct messages. In synchronous Java, this would have been a single method like public int random(), blocking the caller until the random is computed.\n\nThen declare a second thing fragment, which includes the former one, and group messages into a port:\nthing fragment Random includes RandomMsg{\n    provided port random {\n        receives request\n        sends answer\n    }\n}\n\n\nThingML would allow defining only one thing fragment containing both the message declarations and the port. However, if a thing want to use a timer, it will need to include the timer messages. Splitting message and port declarations favors a better reuse:\n\nthing fragment RandomUser includes RandomMsg{\n    required port random {\n        sends request\n        receives answer\n    }\n}\nCalling native code from ThingML\nCalling native code, for any target language, is realized as follows:\n\nfor pure native statement: they should be place between simple quotes, such as 'srand(time(NULL));\nfor mixed code, typically if a call to a native function should be passed with parameters coming from ThingML, it is realized as follows: '' & rn & '.nextInt(Short.MAX_VALUE + 1)', where rn is a ThingML variable (holding a Java type).\n\nThe implementation (wrapping) of the random facility is given below, for C and for Java.\ncalling C/C++ code\nimport \"../random.thingml\"\n\nthing RandomLinux includes Random\n@c_headers \"#include \"\n{\n    statechart Random init start {\n        state start {\n            on entry 'srand(time(NULL));'\n            transition ->waiting\n        }\n        state waiting {\n          internal waiting\n            event random?request\n            action random!answer('rand()')\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nFirst, the @c_headers \"#include \" annotation ensure the RandomLinux thing includes the proper C headers. When the thing is initialized, it will initialize the random sequence by calling the C srand(time(NULL)) function and will then wait for request and serve random integers by calling the C rand function.\ncalling Java code\nimport \"../random.thingml\"\n\ndatatype JavaRandom\n@java_type \"java.util.Random\";\n\nthing RandomJava includes Random\n{\n    property rn : JavaRandom = 'new java.util.Random()'\n    statechart Random init waiting {\n        state waiting {\n          internal waiting\n            event random?request\n            action random!answer('' & rn & '.nextInt(Short.MAX_VALUE + 1)')\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nFirst, a datatype is created, backed by the java.util.Random class. This datatype is initialized in the RandomJava thing as follows: property rn : JavaRandom = 'new java.util.Random()'.\n\nThe call to new is actually plain Java code and not a ThingML keyword, as it is placed between single quotes.\n\nSimilarly to the C thing, this thing will then wait for request and serve random integers using '' & rn & '.nextInt(Short.MAX_VALUE + 1)'.\nThis statement mixes ThingML code: rn is a ThingML property (though it is mapped to a Java type), while .nextInt(Short.MAX_VALUE + 1) is plain Java code.\n\nThingML Integer are actually 2-byte long and thus cannot be mapped to Java int. They are rather mapped on Java short. The Short.MAX_VALUE + 1 expression ensures the java int produced by nextIntdoes not overflow the ThingML Integer (i.e., a Java short).\n\nCalling ThingML code from native code\nThe previous example simply called native code from a ThingML program. In more advanced cases, it is however useful to be able to call ThingML code from a native API (typically when wrapping a library relying on callbacks).\nin C/C++\nTo do so one should adapt/wrap a native C/C++ library in such a away that the library can call callbacks which execute the ThingML generated code. We propose to adapt/wrap the native (wrapped) library in a library (wrapping library) which can call the generated code in ThingML. The explanation below is given using C++, but the same approach can be used in C as well.\nContext:\nA sensor returns a value once in a while. There is a library that handles a value update. The library provides a callback which is called on the value update. Thus, a user can implement this callback to process the value or define some logic when a new value is returned. We would like to use this library in ThingML and define logic and process the given value.\n1) Create a type definition for a callback and structure which holds the callback to call from the wrapping library. The type definition and structure should look as follows:\ntypedef void (*pthingMLCallback)(void* _instance, ...);\n\nstruct ThingMLCallback {\n    pthingMLCallback fn_callback;\n    void* instance;\n\n    ThingMLCallback(pthingMLCallback _callback, void* _instance):\n        fn_callback(_callback),\n        instance(_instance){\n    };\n};\nAs one may notice, we use the ellipsis (\"...\"). Thus, the wrapping library can call a function with any number of arguments following _instance. The _instance argument is used by ThingML to identify a thing. Therefore, _instance is an internal concern of ThingML. One should just make sure that a reference to a thing (_instance) is passed together with a reference to the callback. ThingMLCallback has two arguments, i.e. a reference _callback to the callback and void reference _instance to the thing, which is passed as the first argument when the callback is called.\n2) The wrapping library that calls the callback should hold a reference to an instance of ThingMLCallback. For example:\nclass BinarySensor {\n    private:\n        ThingMLCallback* valueUpdatedCallback;\n    public:\n        ...\n        //set ThingML callback\n        void setValueUpdatedCallback(ThingMLCallback* _callback){valueUpdatedCallback = _callback;};\n\n        //function is called by a native library\n        void valueupdate(int value);\n        ...\n}\n3) Call the callback from the wrapping libarary as follows.\nvoid BinarySensor::valueupdate(int value){\n    this->valueUpdatedCallback->fn_callback(this->valueUpdatedCallback->instance, value);\n}\nNote, that the valueupdate(int value) function is called by the native (wrapped) library.\n4) Define a thing which uses the wrapping library. The wrapping library calls the callback function value_change_binarysensor_callback() defined in the thing ZWaveBinarySensor.\nimport \"thingml.thingml\"\n\ndatatype BinarySensor\n@c_type \"BinarySensor*\";\n\nthing ZWaveBinarySensor \n@c_header \"\n#include \n#include \n#include \\\"BinarySensor.h\\\"\n\nusing namespace TinyOpenZWaveApi;\n\"\n{\n    property bs : BinarySensor\n\n    provided port bsport {\n        receives initialize\n    }\n\n    //these are two internal ports shoud be bound together\n    provided port bsportintsend {\n        sends status\n    }\n\n    required port bsportintrecv {\n        receives status\n    }\n\n\n    function value_change_binarysensor_callback()\n    @c_prototype \"void value_change_binarysensor_callback(void *_instance, ...)\"\n    @c_instance_var_name \"(ZWaveBinarySensor_Instance *) _instance\"\n    do\n        'va_list arguments;'\n        'va_start(arguments, _instance);'\n        'int state = va_arg(arguments, int);'\n        'va_end(arguments);'\n        bsportintsend!status('state')\n    end\n\n    function init_binarysensor() do\n        print \"ZwaveBinarySensor: initializing ... \\n\"\n        'ThingMLCallback* value_changed = new ThingMLCallback(value_change_binarysensor_callback, _instance);'\n        bs = 'new BinarySensor();'\n        ''&bs&'->setValueUpdatedCallback(value_changed);'\n    end\n\n    function getState() : Integer do\n        return ''&bs&'->getCurrentValue()'\n    end\n\n\n    statechart behavior init Start {\n\n\n        state Start {\n            on entry do\n                print \"ZwaveBinarySensor: waiting for initialize command ...\\n\"\n            end\n            transition->Ready\n            event bsport?initialize\n            action do\n                init_binarysensor()\n            end\n        }\n\n        state Ready {\n            on entry do\n                print \"ZwaveBinarySensor: ready ...\\n\"\n            end\n\n            internal event e : bsportintrecv?status\n            action do\n                // here may go some code\n            end\n        }\n\n    }\n}\nNote, we use the ThingML capability to bland the ThingML code and sources which are native to some platform (in this case C++). The C++ code is enclosed by the single quotes. \nWe have defined the callback value_change_binarysensor_callback with the signature that corresponds to the typedef from point 1. Make sure that this callback in ThingML should be annotated with @c_prototype and @c_instance_var_name. The annotation @c_prototype instructs ThingML to generate a function with the signature given in the double quotes, @c_instance_var_name casts _instance to the proper type. These annotations are required to perform a call of the callback on the right thing (it is the ZWaveBinarySensor thing in our case) \nFurther, we create an instance of ThingMLCallback that holds references to the callback value_change_binarysensor_callback and ZWaveBinarySensor thing (_instance), i.e. ThingMLCallback* value_changed = new ThingMLCallback(value_change_binarysensor_callback, _instance);. Subsequently, value_changed is passed to the wrapping library, i.e. ''&bs&'->setValueUpdatedCallback(value_changed);'. Now if the native (wrapped) library calls the function which we have implemented in the wrrapping library, i.e. void valueupdate(int)(see the point  2), the wrapper calls the callback function value_change_binarysensor_callback(). Finnally, we can extract a value passed to the callback using va_list and va_arg in function value_change_binarysensor_callback() as well as we can use any ThingML instructions. \nin Java\nIn Java, the easiest way to call ThingML code from a plain Java class is to\n\nMake the Thing extend a Java interface. This is realized by annotating the thing: thing MyThing @java_interface \"my.package.MyInterface\". The methods defined in this Java interface should be implemented in the thing. As ThingML functions are private by default, the function corresponding to the Java methods to be implemented need to be annotated: function myFunction()@override \"true\". This function needs to have the exact same signature as the one defined in the Java interface.\nIn the external Java class, import the Java interface, define a pointer to that interface (a reference or a list), and call the methods of that interface in the Java class\nImplement a registration mechanism in the Java class, so that I can actually call the class generated from the thing (and extending the interface). This can typically be done by defining an extra argument (typed by the interface) in the constructor. The plain Java class can then be created from the thing as follows: 'new my.package.MyClass(this)'. The Java class can then hold a reference to the thingml object (this) and call methods on it.\n\n"},"heads_methodology/extend_the_thingml_transformations_to_compile_code_for_a_new_platform.html":{"url":"heads_methodology/extend_the_thingml_transformations_to_compile_code_for_a_new_platform.html","title":"Extend the ThingML compilers to target a new platform","keywords":"","body":"Extend the ThingML compilers to target a new platform\nWhen a platform expert needs to address a new platform, he typically needs to use the HEADS transformation framework, described in detail in D2.2. This modular Object-Oriented framework defines a set of extension points, each encapsulated as a Java class. For each different language (e.g. Java, JavaScript and C) each of these extension point typically needs to be redefined. For different dialects of the same language (e.g. C for Linux and C for the Arduino microcontrollers), the plaftorm expert can reuse already defined extension point and simply redefine a few of them to finely customize the code that is generated and accomodate with the contraints and specificities of the new platform.\nOverview of the HEADS transformation framework\nThe HEADS code generation framework is structured in a set of modules. The figure 20 below the main sub-modules of the \"Compilers\" project as well as their dependencies. The idea is to have a compilation framework on top which only depends on the HEADS Model. This framework project, detailed later in this section, captures all the code and helpers to be shared between compilers. It also defines the interfaces (as abstract classes) for all the compilers. Below, individual modules correspond to the implementation of different families of compilers (Java, JavaScript, C, etc). The idea of these modules is to package together sets of compilers which have the same target languages (and typically share quite a lot of code). Finally, one the bottom, the registry module puts together all the compilers and provides a simple utility to execute them from the command line.\n\nThe idea of the code generation framework is to provide a way to independently customize different extension points. The figure below presents the 8 different extension points we have identified. Current implementation of the framework supports customizing all those extension points. However, at this point all developers are encouraged to propose and implement refactoring in order to make the APIs clear and as decoupled as possible.\n\nThe figure above presents the 8 extension points of the HEADS code generation framework. These extension points are separated in two groups: the ones corresponding to the generation of code for Types or \"Things\" and the ones corresponding to the generation of code for the Instances or Configuration. \nActions / Expressions / Functions\nThis part of the code generator corresponds to the code generated for actions, expressions and functions contained in a Thing. The generated code mostly depends on the language supported by the target platform (C, Java, etc.), and the code generators should be quite reusable across different platforms supporting the same language. The implementation of this extension point consists of a visitor on the Actions and Expressions part of the metamodel. New code generators can be created by inheriting from that abstract visitor and implementing all its methods. Alternatively, if only a minor modification of an existing code generator is needed, it is possible to inherit from the existing visitor and only override a subset of its methods.\nBehavior Implementation\nThis part of the code generator corresponds to the code generated from the state machine structures, ECA and CEP rules contained in Things. There are main strategies and frameworks available in the literature in order to implement state machines. Depending on the capabilities, languages and libraries available on the target platform, the platform expert should have the flexibility of specifying how the behaviour is mapped to executable code. In some cases, the code generator can produce the entire code for the state machines, for example using a state machine design pattern in C++ or Java, and in other cases the code generator might rely on an existing framework available on the target platform, such as state.js for executing JavaScript state machines or ReactiveX for executing CEP queries in JavaScript or Java. To allow for this flexibility, the HEADS transformation framework should provide a set of helpers to traverse the different metaclasses responsible for modelling the behaviour and leave the freedom of creating new concrete generators and/or customizing existing code generator templates. In order to check the \"correctness\" of a particular code generator with respect to the language semantics, a set of reusable test cases has been created and should pass on any customized code generator.\nPorts / Messages / Thing APIs\nThis part of the code generator corresponds to the wrapping of \"things\" into reusable components on the target platform. Depending on the target platform, the language and the context in which the application is deployed, the code generated for a \"thing\" can be tailored to generate either custom modules or to fit particular coding constraints or middleware to be used on the target platform. At this level, a Thing is a black box which should offer an API to send and receive messages through its ports. In practice this should be customized by the platform experts in order to fit the best practices and frameworks available on the target platform. As a best practice, the generated modules and APIs for things should be manually usable in case the rest of the system (or part of it) is written directly in the target language. For example, in object oriented languages, a facade and the observer pattern can be used to provide an easy to use API for the generated code. In C, a module with the proper header with structures and call-backs should be generated.\nConnectors / Channels\nThis part of the code generator is in charge of generating the code corresponding to the connectors and transporting messages from one Thing to the next. This is the client side of the APIs generated for the Things. In practice the connector can connect two things running in the same process on a single platform or things which are remotely connected through some sort of network (from a simple serial link to any point to point communication over a network stack). The way the code is generated should be tailored to the specific way messages should be serialized, transmitted and de-serialized. In order to customize this part of the code generator, the HEADS framework offers a set of helpers which allow listing all messages to be transported and pruning unused messages in order to generate only the necessary code. The dispatch and queuing of the messages has been separated out from the serialization and transport in order to allow for more flexibility.\nMessage Queuing / FIFOs\nThis part of the generator is related to the connectors and channels but is specifically used to tailor how messages are handled when the connectors are between two things running on the same platform. When the connectors are between things separated by a network or some sort of inter-process communication, the asynchronous nature of messages is ensured by construction. However, inside a single process specific additional code should be generated in order to store messages in FIFOs and dispatch them asynchronously. Depending on the target platform, the platform expert might reuse existing message queues provided by the operating system or a specific framework. If no message queuing service is available, like on the Arduino platform for example, the code for the queues can be fully generated.\nScheduling / Dispatch\nThis part of the code generator is in charge of generating the code which orchestrates the set of Things running on one platform. The generated code should activate successively the state machines of each component and handle the dispatch of messages between the components using the channels and message queues. Depending on the target platform, the scheduling can be based on the use of operating system services, threads, an active object design pattern or any other suitable strategy.\nInitialization and \"Main\"\nThis part of the code generator is in charge of generating the entry point and initialization code in order to set up and start the generated application on the target platform. The HEADS transformation framework provides some helpers to list the instances to be created, the connections to be made and the set of variables to be initialized together with their initial values.\nProject structure / Build script\nThe last extension point is not generating code as such, but the required file structure and builds scripts in order to make the generated code well packaged and easy to compile and deploy on the target platform. The HEADS transformation framework provides access to all the buffers in which the code has been generated and allows creating the file structure which fits the particular target platform. For example, the Arduino compiler concatenates all the generated code into a single file which can be opened by the Arduino IDE. The Linux C code generator creates separate C modules with header files and generates a Makefile to compile the application. The Java and Scala code generators create Maven project and pom.xml files in order to allow compiling and deploying the generated code. The platform expert can customize the project structure and build scripts in order to fit the best practices of the target platform.\nHow to write a (family of) compiler(s)?\nFor the different extension point we have presented earlier, we will use concrete compilers that we have implemented to show how to write your own compiler. \nActions / Expressions / Functions\nTo illustrate the HEADS Action compiler and show how to implement a family of compilers, we will take the example of the C family, composed of two compilers: Linux/POSIX and Arduino. Those two compilers share most of their code and re-define a few extension points for the parts where they differ.\nThe HEADS action language is fairly aligned with common programming languages, such as Java, C or JavaScript. Most of the actions and expressions can actually be factorized in a generic class:\npublic class CommonThingActionCompiler extends ThingActionCompiler {\n    @Override\n    public void generate(ConditionalAction action, StringBuilder builder, Context ctx) {//if(...) {...} else {...}\n        builder.append(\"if(\");\n        generate(action.getCondition(), builder, ctx);\n        builder.append(\") {\\n\");\n        generate(action.getAction(), builder, ctx);\n        builder.append(\"\\n}\");\n        if (action.getElseAction() != null) {\n            builder.append(\" else {\\n\");\n            generate(action.getElseAction(), builder, ctx);\n            builder.append(\"\\n}\");\n        }\n        builder.append(\"\\n\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void generate(LoopAction action, StringBuilder builder, Context ctx) {//while(...) {...}\n        builder.append(\"while(\");\n        generate(action.getCondition(), builder, ctx);\n        builder.append(\") {\\n\");\n        generate(action.getAction(), builder, ctx);\n        builder.append(\"\\n}\\n\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void generate(PlusExpression expression, StringBuilder builder, Context ctx) {// ... + ...\n        generate(expression.getLhs(), builder, ctx);\n        builder.append(\" + \");\n        generate(expression.getRhs(), builder, ctx);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void generate(MinusExpression expression, StringBuilder builder, Context ctx) {// ... - ...\n        generate(expression.getLhs(), builder, ctx);\n        builder.append(\" - \");\n        generate(expression.getRhs(), builder, ctx);\n    }\n\n    ...\n}\n\nThe ActionCompiler class basically defines a method for each of the concepts of the HEADS action language. It is thus possible to organize a hierarchy of sub-classes that gradually redfine those methods. For example, the general C compiler just need to redefine some methods (9 in total):\npublic abstract class CThingActionCompiler extends CommonThingActionCompiler {\n    @Override\n    public void generate(BooleanLiteral expression, StringBuilder builder, Context ctx) {\n        if (expression.isBoolValue())\n            builder.append(\"1\");\n        else\n            builder.append(\"0\");\n    }\n    ...\n}\n\nFinally, the Linux/POSIX compiler only needs to redefine two methods related to printing on the standard/error output:\npublic class CThingActionCompilerPosix extends CThingActionCompiler {\n\n    @Override\n    public void generate(ErrorAction action, StringBuilder builder, Context ctx) {\n        final StringBuilder b = new StringBuilder();\n        generate(action.getMsg(), b, ctx);\n        builder.append(\"fprintf(stderr, \" + b.toString() + \");\\n\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void generate(PrintAction action, StringBuilder builder, Context ctx) {\n        final StringBuilder b = new StringBuilder();\n        generate(action.getMsg(), b, ctx);\n        builder.append(\"fprintf(stdout, \" + b.toString() + \");\\n\");\n    }\n\n}\n\nThe same goes for the Arduino compiler:\npublic class CThingActionCompilerArduino extends CThingActionCompiler {\n\n    @Override\n    public void generate(ErrorAction action, StringBuilder builder, Context ctx) {\n        final StringBuilder b = new StringBuilder();\n        generate(action.getMsg(), b, ctx);\n\n        builder.append(\"// PRINT ERROR: \" + b.toString());\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void generate(PrintAction action, StringBuilder builder, Context ctx) {\n        final StringBuilder b = new StringBuilder();\n        generate(action.getMsg(), b, ctx);\n        if (ctx.getCurrentConfiguration().hasAnnotation(\"arduino_stdout\")) {\n            builder.append(ctx.getCurrentConfiguration().annotation(\"arduino_stdout\").iterator().next() + \".print(\" + b.toString() + \");\\n\");\n        } else {\n            builder.append(\"// PRINT: \" + b.toString());\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n\n\nIn case a platform expert wants to target a language that is very different from the Java/C/JavaScript family (e.g LISP using a prefix/Polish notation where a typical/infix a + b would be expressed + a b), he might need to redefine all the concepts, directly by inheriting from the top class ThingActionCompiler\n\nBehavior Implementation\nDifferent approaches exist when it comes to the compilation of the behavior (mostly state machine-based, with optional extensions for CEP):\n\ntarget and existing framework\ngenerate all code from scratch, including the code for how to dispatch event to concurrent regions, etc\n\nBoth approaches have pros and cons. Using a framework typically reduces the size and complexity of the code to be generated (and of the compilers), as most of the code is directly written in the framework. However, frameworks tend to be generic and might typically include more than what is needed, hence have a larger overhead. The full generative approach gives more flexibility and makes it possible to control each bits and bytes, and optimize the code for a particular state machine (whereas the framework needs to handle any possible state machine), but are typically more complex to implement.\nThe Java and JavaScript behavior compilers use a framework-based approach, which is rather idiomatic for those language, whereas the C compiler, which is expected to generate code able to run down to small micro-controllers (2KB RAM) uses a full generative approach to avoid any accidental overhead.\nBecause of the diversity of solutions that can be implemented for this extension point, the high level interface is rather generic so as not to constrain the platform expert:\npublic class ThingImplCompiler {\n\n    public void generateImplementation(Thing thing, Context ctx) {\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nPlaform experts are however encouraged to implement the generateImplementation  method in a modular way, split into several sub-methods.\nThe following code snippet instantiate a composite state by using the state.js JavaScript library:\n    protected void generateCompositeState(CompositeState c, StringBuilder builder, Context ctx) {\n        String containerName = ctx.getContextAnnotation(\"container\");\n        if (c.hasSeveralRegions()) {\n            builder.append(\"var \" + c.qname(\"_\") + \" = new StateJS.Region(\\\"\" + c.getName() + \"\\\", \" + containerName + \");\\n\");\n            builder.append(\"var \" + c.qname(\"_\") + \"_default = new StateJS.Region(\\\"_default\\\", \" + c.qname(\"_\") + \");\\n\");\n            if (c.isHistory())\n                builder.append(\"var _initial_\" + c.qname(\"_\") + \" = new StateJS.pseudoState(\\\"_initial\\\", \" + c.qname(\"_\") + \", StateJS.PseudoStateKind.ShallowHistory);\\n\");\n            else\n                builder.append(\"var _initial_\" + c.qname(\"_\") + \" = new StateJS.pseudoState(\\\"_initial\\\", \" + c.qname(\"_\") + \", StateJS.PseudoStateKind.Initial);\\n\");\n            builder.append(\"_initial_\" + c.qname(\"_\") + \".to(\" + c.getInitial().qname(\"_\") + \");\\n\");\n            for (State s : c.getSubstate()) {\n                ctx.addContextAnnotation(\"container\", c.qname(\"_\") + \"_default\");\n                generateState(s, builder, ctx);\n            }\n            for (Region r : c.getRegion()) {\n                ctx.addContextAnnotation(\"container\", c.qname(\"_\"));\n                generateRegion(r, builder, ctx);\n            }\n        } else {\n            builder.append(\"var \" + c.qname(\"_\") + \" = new StateJS.State(\\\"\" + c.getName() + \"\\\", \" + containerName + \")\");\n            generateActionsForState(c, builder, ctx);\n            builder.append(\";\\n\");\n            for (State s : c.getSubstate()) {\n                ctx.addContextAnnotation(\"container\", c.qname(\"_\"));\n                generateState(s, builder, ctx);\n            }\n        }\n        if (c.isHistory())\n            builder.append(\"var _initial_\" + c.qname(\"_\") + \" = new StateJS.PseudoState(\\\"_initial\\\", \" + c.qname(\"_\") + \", StateJS.PseudoStateKind.ShallowHistory);\\n\");\n        else\n            builder.append(\"var _initial_\" + c.qname(\"_\") + \" = new StateJS.PseudoState(\\\"_initial\\\", \" + c.qname(\"_\") + \", StateJS.PseudoStateKind.Initial);\\n\");\n        builder.append(\"_initial_\" + c.qname(\"_\") + \".to(\" + c.getInitial().qname(\"_\") + \");\\n\");\n    }\n\n\nBased on its extensive suite of tests, the HEADS transformation framework was able to detect a few bugs in the popular state.js library (~200 likes on GitHub and ~1000 Download a month on NPM), that were rapidly fixed by the repository maintainer.\n\nPorts / Messages / Thing APIs\nThe goal of this extension point is to generate proper interface so that the generated code can easily be used and integrated by third-parties, using or not the HEADS technologies. For example a timer component which can receive two messages timer_start and timer_cancel on a port timer and can emit a timer_timeout message on a port timer can be addressed in Java through a couple of interface (the second one serving as a callback):\npublic interface ITimerJava_timer{\n    void timer_start_via_timer(short TimerMsgs_timer_start_delay__var);\n    void timer_cancel_via_timer();\n}\n\npublic interface ITimerJava_timerClient{\n    void timer_timeout_from_timer();\n}\n\nA third-party wanting to use this simple HEADS-enabled timer would thus, in plain Java implement ITimerJava_timerClient interface, and after instantiating a timer, register as a listener:\nTimerJava timer = new TimerJava().buildBehavior();\ntimer.registerOnTimer(new ITimerJava_timerClient(){\n    @Override \n    timer_timeout_from_timer(){\n        System.out.println(\"timeout!\");\n    }\n});\ntimer.init();\ntimer.start();\ntimer.timer_start_via_timer(5000);//timeout! to be displayed in 5000 ms\n\nSimilarly in JavaScript:\n// Public methods on the timer\nTimerJS.prototype.timer_startOntimer = function(delay) {\n...\n};\n\nTimerJS.prototype.timer_cancelOntimer = function() {\n...\n};\n\nvar timer = new TimerJS();\ntimer.build();\ntimer.getTimer_timeoutontimerListeners().push(function(){console.log(\"timeout!\");});\ntimer.init();\ntimer.timer_startOntimer(5000);//timeout! to be displayed in 5000 ms\n\nAnd in C:\nvoid TimerLinux_handle_timer_timer_start(struct TimerLinux_Instance *_instance, int delay);\nvoid TimerLinux_handle_timer_timer_cancel(struct TimerLinux_Instance *_instance);\nvoid register_external_TimerLinux_send_timer_timer_timeout_listener(void (*_listener)(struct TimerLinux_Instance *));\n\nvoid printCallBack(){\n    fprintf(\"timeout!\\n\");\n}\nstruct TimerLinux_Instance TestTimerLinux_timer_var;\nregister_TimerLinux_send_timer_timer_timeout_listener(&printCallBack);\nTimerLinux_handle_timer_timer_start(&TestTimerLinux_timer_var, 5000);//timeout! to be displayed in 5000 ms\n\nAs this code is only structural (basically a set of methods), it is fairly easy to generate. Here is how we generate Java interfaces of components:\n    //Generate interfaces that the thing will implement, for others to call this API\n    for (Port p : thing.allPorts()) {\n        if (!p.isDefined(\"public\", \"false\") && p.getReceives().size() > 0) {\n            final StringBuilder builder = ctx.getBuilder(src + \"/api/I\" + ctx.firstToUpper(thing.getName()) + \"_\" + p.getName() + \".java\");\n            builder.append(\"package \" + pack + \".api;\\n\\n\");\n            builder.append(\"import \" + pack + \".api.*;\\n\\n\");\n            builder.append(\"public interface \" + \"I\" + ctx.firstToUpper(thing.getName()) + \"_\" + p.getName() + \"{\\n\");\n            for (Message m : p.getReceives()) {\n                builder.append(\"void \" + m.getName() + \"_via_\" + p.getName() + \"(\");\n                JavaHelper.generateParameter(m, builder, ctx);\n                builder.append(\");\\n\");\n            }\n            builder.append(\"}\");\n        }\n    }\n\nConnectors / Channels\nIn HEADS, connectors and channels are managed by the HEADS runtime. By default the generated code is \"standalone\" and can be run without the HEADS runtime. To be able to run on the HEADS runtime, this require some wrappers around the implementation. Those wrappers are generated and only interact with the public interface of the component (as a developper would normally write). For example, the following code generates for the JavaScript HEADS runtime. A more conceptual view of this wrapping is provided in D2.2.\n    private void generateWrapper(Context ctx, Configuration cfg) {\n        final StringBuilder builder = ctx.getBuilder(cfg.getName() + \"/lib/\" + cfg.getName() + \".js\");\n        builder.append(\"var AbstractComponent = require('kevoree-entities').AbstractComponent;\\n\");\n\n        for (Thing t : cfg.allThings()) {//load of the fined-grained component into the coarse grained component\n            builder.append(\"var \" + t.getName() + \" = require('./\" + t.getName() + \"');\\n\");\n        }\n\n        builder.append(\"/**\\n* Kevoree component\\n* @type {\" + cfg.getName() + \"}\\n*/\\n\");\n        builder.append(\"var \" + cfg.getName() + \" = AbstractComponent.extend({\\n\");\n        builder.append(\"toString: '\" + cfg.getName() + \"',\\n\");\n\n        builder.append(\"construct: function() {\\n\");\n        JSCfgMainGenerator.generateInstances(cfg, builder, ctx, true);\n        for (Map.Entry e : cfg.danglingPorts().entrySet()) {\n            final Instance i = (Instance) e.getKey();\n            for (Port p : (List) e.getValue()) {\n                for (Message m : p.getSends()) {\n                    builder.append(\"this.\" + i.getName() + \".get\" + ctx.firstToUpper(m.getName()) + \"on\" + p.getName() + \"Listeners().push(this.\" + shortName(i, p, m) + \"_proxy.bind(this));\\n\");\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        builder.append(\"},\\n\\n\");\n\n\n        builder.append(\"start: function (done) {\\n\");\n        for (Instance i : cfg.danglingPorts().keySet()) {\n            builder.append(\"this.\" + i.getName() + \"._init();\\n\");\n        }\n        builder.append(\"done();\\n\");\n        builder.append(\"},\\n\\n\");\n\n\n        builder.append(\"stop: function (done) {\\n\");\n        for (Instance i : cfg.allInstances()) {\n            builder.append(\"this.\" + i.getName() + \"._stop();\\n\");\n        }\n        builder.append(\"done();\\n\");\n        builder.append(\"}\");\n\n        for (Map.Entry e : cfg.danglingPorts().entrySet()) {\n            final Instance i = (Instance) e.getKey();\n            for (Port p : (List) e.getValue()) {\n                for (Message m : p.getReceives()) {\n                    builder.append(\",\\nin_\" + shortName(i, p, m) + \"_in: function (msg) {\\n\");\n                    builder.append(\"this.\" + i.getName() + \".receive\" + m.getName() + \"On\" + p.getName() + \"(msg.split(';'));\\n\");\n                    builder.append(\"}\");\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        for (Map.Entry e : cfg.danglingPorts().entrySet()) {\n            final Instance i = (Instance) e.getKey();\n            for (Port p : (List) e.getValue()) {\n                for (Message m : p.getSends()) {\n                    builder.append(\",\\n\" + shortName(i, p, m) + \"_proxy: function() {this.out_\" + shortName(i, p, m) + \"_out(\");\n                    int index = 0;\n                    for (Parameter pa : m.getParameters()) {\n                        if (index > 0)\n                            builder.append(\" + ';' + \");\n                        builder.append(\"arguments[\" + index + \"]\");\n                        index++;\n                    }\n                    if (index > 1)\n                        builder.append(\"''\");\n                    builder.append(\");}\");\n                    builder.append(\",\\nout_\" + shortName(i, p, m) + \"_out: function(msg) {/* This will be overwritten @runtime by Kevoree JS */}\");\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        builder.append(\"});\\n\\n\");\n        builder.append(\"module.exports = \" + cfg.getName() + \";\\n\");\n    }\n\nMessage queuing / Scheduling / Dispatch\nThis extension point allows customizing the code generated for handling how the messages and the control are distributed among of set of component instances. From a semantic point of view, each component instance is an independent process which exchanges messages with other components in an asynchronous way. To implement this semantic, a wide range of alternatives for queuing messages, distributing them to the components can be used depending on the capabilities of the targeted platforms. Features for message exchange and multi-tasking are typically provided by operating systems or middleware platforms. In the case of resource constrained devices with no operating system, code has to be generated to fully handle the scheduling and message dispatch between components.\nThe API for customizing the code generator for those aspect is in class \"org.thingml.compilers.configuration.CfgMainGenerator\" and its sub-classes for the different platforms.\nThe example bellow shows how messages are queued when generating code for microcontrollers. The generated code includes a compact FIFO implementation for storing messages. The messages are serialized in the FIFO when they are emitted by a component and later processed and dispatched to the receiving components.\n// Enqueue of messages HelloTimer::timer::timer_start\nvoid enqueue_HelloTimer_send_timer_timer_start(struct HelloTimer_Instance *_instance, int delay){\n    if ( fifo_byte_available() > 6 ) {\n\n        _fifo_enqueue( (3 >> 8) & 0xFF );\n        _fifo_enqueue( 3 & 0xFF );\n\n        // ID of the source port of the instance\n        _fifo_enqueue( (_instance->id_timer >> 8) & 0xFF );\n        _fifo_enqueue( _instance->id_timer & 0xFF );\n\n        // parameter delay\n        union u_delay_t {\n            int p;\n            byte bytebuffer[2];\n        } u_delay;\n        u_delay.p = delay;\n        _fifo_enqueue( u_delay.bytebuffer[1] & 0xFF );\n        _fifo_enqueue( u_delay.bytebuffer[0] & 0xFF );\n    }\n}\nThe following listing shows how the messages are dispatched from the FIFO to the appropriate component.\nvoid processMessageQueue() {\n    if (fifo_empty()) return; // return if there is nothing to do\n\n    byte mbuf[4];\n    uint8_t mbufi = 0;\n\n    // Read the code of the next port/message in the queue\n    uint16_t code = fifo_dequeue() In the Arduino code generator, the main loop of the scheduler simply activates the components which use polling and processes messages from the queue.  The component receiving a message is given the CPU for processing this message. Any message produced by the component is queued and will be later processed by the receiver. This strategy ensures that each component gets activated in turn and that the processing of a message in executed as a whole. In the case of microcontrollers, it can be interrupted by microcontroller interrupts but not by the processing of another message.\nvoid loop() {\n    TimerArduino_handle_Polling_poll(&TestTimerArduino_timer_var);\n    HelloTimer_handle_empty_event(&TestTimerArduino_client_var);\n    processMessageQueue();\n}\nDepending on the level of dynamicity required, code can be generated statically for one particular configuration (and set of connector), but even on tiny and small targets code can be generated to handle dynamically dispatching messages according to a dynamic set of connectors. The code bellow illustrates how it is done in the Arduino compiler.\n//Dynamic dispatch for message timer_start\nvoid dispatch_timer_start(uint16_t sender, int param_delay) {\nvoid executor_dispatch_timer_start(struct Msg_Handler ** head, struct Msg_Handler ** tail) {\nstruct Msg_Handler ** cur = head;\nwhile (cur != NULL) {\n   void (*handler)(void *, int param_delay) = NULL;\n   int i;\n   for(i = 0; i Initialization and \"Main\"\nThis extension point is responsible for instantiating components and properly set the attributes of these instances with proper values. It is also responsible for connecting instances together. Here is an example of a \"main\" in JavaScript:\n//import types\nvar TimerJS = require('./TimerJS');\nvar SimpleTimerClient = require('./SimpleTimerClient');\n\n//Create and initialize instances\nvar TestTimerJS_timer = new TimerJS(\"TestTimerJS_timer\", false);\nTestTimerJS_timer.setThis(TestTimerJS_timer);\nTestTimerJS_timer.build();\nvar TestTimerJS_client = new SimpleTimerClient(\"TestTimerJS_client\", 1000, 5000, true);\nTestTimerJS_client.setThis(TestTimerJS_client);\nTestTimerJS_client.build();\n\n//Connect instances together\nTestTimerJS_timer.getTimer_timeoutontimerListeners().push(TestTimerJS_client.receivetimer_timeoutOntimer.bind(TestTimerJS_client));\nTestTimerJS_client.getTimer_startontimerListeners().push(TestTimerJS_timer.receivetimer_startOntimer.bind(TestTimerJS_timer));\nTestTimerJS_client.getTimer_cancelontimerListeners().push(TestTimerJS_timer.receivetimer_cancelOntimer.bind(TestTimerJS_timer));\n\n//start instances\nTestTimerJS_timer._init();\nTestTimerJS_client._init();\n\n//register hookup to properly stop instances\nprocess.on('SIGINT', function () {\n    console.log(\"Stopping components...\");\n    TestTimerJS_timer._stop();\n    TestTimerJS_client._stop();\n});\n\nThe plaform expert needs to extend the following class to generate the main:\npublic class CfgMainGenerator {\n    public void generateMainAndInit(Configuration cfg, ThingMLModel model, Context ctx) {\n    }\n}\n\nThe following code snippet illustrate how to generate the code for the connectors:\n        for (Connector c : cfg.allConnectors()) {\n            for (Message req : c.getRequired().getReceives()) {\n                for (Message prov : c.getProvided().getSends()) {\n                    if (req.getName().equals(prov.getName())) {\n                        builder.append(prefix + c.getSrv().getInstance().getName() + \".get\" + ctx.firstToUpper(prov.getName()) + \"on\" + c.getProvided().getName() + \"Listeners().push(\");\n                        builder.append(prefix + c.getCli().getInstance().getName() + \".receive\" + req.getName() + \"On\" + c.getRequired().getName() + \".bind(\" + prefix + c.getCli().getInstance().getName() + \")\");\n                        builder.append(\");\\n\");\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            for (Message req : c.getProvided().getReceives()) {\n                for (Message prov : c.getRequired().getSends()) {\n                    if (req.getName().equals(prov.getName())) {\n                        builder.append(prefix + c.getCli().getInstance().getName() + \".get\" + ctx.firstToUpper(prov.getName()) + \"on\" + c.getRequired().getName() + \"Listeners().push(\");\n                        builder.append(prefix + c.getSrv().getInstance().getName() + \".receive\" + req.getName() + \"On\" + c.getProvided().getName() + \".bind(\" + prefix + c.getSrv().getInstance().getName() + \")\");\n                        builder.append(\");\\n\");\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\nProject structure / Build script\nTo make the HEADS components easily reusable, with our without the HEADS technologies, they must be properly package. For Java, we for example generate proper Maven project, for JavaScript, NPM projects, and for C, Makefile. If a platform expert would like to use Gradle instead of manage, he would need to re-define the following extension point:\npublic class CfgBuildCompiler {\n\n\n    public void generateBuildScript(Configuration cfg, Context ctx) {\n        throw (new UnsupportedOperationException(\"Project structure and build scripts are platform-specific.\"));\n    }\n}\n\nHere is for example how we generate a package.json for NPM projects:\npublic class JSCfgBuildCompiler extends CfgBuildCompiler {\n\n    @Override\n    public void generateBuildScript(Configuration cfg, Context ctx) {\n        try {\n            final InputStream input = this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(\"javascript/lib/package.json\");\n            final List packLines = IOUtils.readLines(input);\n            String pack = \"\";\n            for (String line : packLines) {\n                pack += line + \"\\n\";\n            }\n            input.close();\n            pack = pack.replace(\"\", cfg.getName());\n\n            final JsonObject json = JsonObject.readFrom(pack);\n            final JsonValue deps = json.get(\"dependencies\");\n            for (Thing t : cfg.allThings()) {\n                for (String dep : t.annotation(\"js_dep\")) {\n                    deps.asObject().add(dep.split(\":\")[0].trim(), dep.split(\":\")[1].trim());\n                }\n\n            }\n\n            boolean addCEPdeps = false;\n            boolean addDebugDeps = !ctx.getCompiler().getDebugProfiles().isEmpty();\n\n            for (Thing t : cfg.allThings()) {\n                if (t.getStreams().size() > 0) {\n                    addCEPdeps = true;\n                }\n            }\n\n            if(addCEPdeps) {\n                deps.asObject().add(\"rx\", \"^2.5.3\");\n                deps.asObject().add(\"events\", \"^1.0.2\");\n            }\n\n            if(addDebugDeps) {\n                deps.asObject().add(\"colors\", \"^1.1.2\");\n            }\n\n            final File f = new File(ctx.getOutputDirectory() + \"/\" + cfg.getName() + \"/package.json\");\n            f.setWritable(true);\n            final PrintWriter w = new PrintWriter(new FileWriter(f));\n            w.println(json.toString());\n            w.close();\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n\nThis would produce this kind of output:\n{\n    \"name\" : \"TestTimerJS\",\n    \"version\" : \"1.0.0\",\n    \"description\" : \"TestTimerJS configuration generated from ThingML\",\n    \"main\" : \"main.js\",\n    \"private\" : true,\n    \"dependencies\" : {\n        \"state.js\" : \"^5.3.4\",\n        \"colors\" : \"^1.1.2\"\n    },\n    \"devDependencies\" : {},\n    \"scripts\" : {}\n\n}\n\nNote that this compiler (as well as others) uses a template to simplify the code generation, since most of the content of package.json is fixed:\n{\n  \"name\": \"\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \" configuration generated from ThingML\",\n  \"main\": \"main.js\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"state.js\": \"^5.3.4\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n  }\n}\n\nLightweight extension to existing compilers\nWhen new target languages, operating systems or core libraries need to be supported, the platform expert has to extend the ThingML compilers/transformation. The ThingML compilers are modular so that different parts can be reused and extended separately.\nThingML supports for adding annotations on most elements of the language. The platform expert can define specific annotations which are exploited in the code generator in order to support platform specific features.\nFor example, a thing dealing with IO typically needs to listen continuously for inputs to arrive. This behavior should be executed in a separate thread so that it does not block or slow down the execution of the core business logic. This multi-threaded behavior can be achieved in the Linux/C compiler using the @fork_linux_thread annotation.\nfunction serial_receiver_process()\n@fork_linux_thread \"true\"\ndo\nvar buffer : Byte[256] // Data read from the serial port\nwhile (true) {\n    //read bytes from serial port\n}\nend\nThe C compiler will interprete this annotation and generate multi-threaded code, which wraps the code) normally generated by the compiler without that annotation:\n    if (func.isDefined(\"fork_linux_thread\", \"true\")) {\n        generateCforThingLinuxThread(func, thing, builder, ctx);\n    } else { // Use the default function generator\n        generateCforThingDirect(func, thing, builder, ctx);\n    }\n\n\nIf an annotation is intensively used and relevant for most compilers, the concept can be promoted directly into the language so that it can be benefit from better tool support (annotations being simple string-based key/value entries). The extension of the HEADS modelling language is however beyond the scope of the HEADS project, but interested reader can read about the way we extended the language to support Complex Event Processing. \n\n"},"heads_methodology/thingml_plugins.html":{"url":"heads_methodology/thingml_plugins.html","title":"Implement a ThingML plugin to target a new protocol","keywords":"","body":"Typically, a ThingML component can be required to communicate with three type of components:\n\nThingML system: In some situations, a developer can model applications with ThingML for both ends of the communication. In this case, communication stacks can be fully generated. The code generation framework must be extensible in order to edibility on the choice of the transport protocol.\nOpen systems: In some other case, a ThingML component needs to communicate with another software component, whose sources are accessible to the developer. It is either possible to adapt the ThingML end, or to adapt the other one by generating code in its language. In addition to the support of a specific protocol, the code generation framework must also be adaptable in terms of message encoding. Indeed, the encoding must be understandable by the non-ThingML part of the application, or this part must be changed to understand ThingML messages.\nProprietary systems: In many cases a ThingML component will have to communicate with external closed-source components, whose implementation cannot be modified. In this case, the only option is to adapt the ThingML end both in terms of encoding and transport.\n\nRegardless of the situation, code needs to be generated (at least for the ThingML end) in order to handle the following tasks:\n\nEncoding/Decoding: In order to exchange data between different platforms, a serialization scheme must be chosen. While there exist numerous solutions and standards, many distributed applications need to leverage several of them. Indeed, the choice among them can be driven by various concerns (bandwidth, human readability). Furthermore, it is not always a choice, in the case where a component needs to communicate with a proprietary system, which already fixed the format for some exchanges.\nSending/Receiving: Code must be generated to support both message emission and reception adapted to the targeted protocol. For most cases these operations rely heavily on a pre-existing library in the targeted language. But it can require additional aspects depending on the paradigm. For example, for synchronous communications, a message can not necessarily be sent any time, and some queuing might be required.\nConfiguration and Link management: Before any message exchange occurs, a network interface has typically to be configured, and depending on the protocol a connection might have to be established. Furthermore, some network paradigms require some additional logic such as keeping track of connected clients.\n\nNetwork Plugins\nThrough a set of experiments (Serial, HTTP/REST, MQTT, WebSocket, Bluetooth Low Energy, Z-Wave, etc.) it quickly appears that a part of the complexity coming from these various communication protocols can be hidden from the model, because they are not relevant to the application logic (Automatic re-sending of messages, connection establishment, a part of error management, encryption). Network plugin can generate code handling these \"technicalities\".\nMeanwhile, a part of this complexity needs to be exposed to the ThingML code to enable a communication management flexible enough. In order to do so, the ThingML code generation framework differentiates two aspects of communication management (See Figure 10):\n\nConfiguration: Through the mean of annotation on the ThingML keyword protocol, configuration at design time can be provided to the code generator in order to generate a tailor-made network interface. \nControl: A part of the communication handling (such as error management, client management) is inherently dynamic and hence the need for information exchange between the application logic and the generated network library at run time.\n\n\nTwo broad types of annotations can be used to control more precisely a generated library at run time. Annotated messages can be transformed into instructions addressed at the generated network library and not forwarded (for example, a reconnection instruction). Similarly, annotated messages can become feedback originating from the network library and transmitted to the application (for example if the connection has been lost). But additional parameters (that\nwill not be forwarded) can also be added to messages in order to customize at run time the way those messages are forwarded (for example destination information).\nthing fragment myMsgs { //Control at run time\n  message reconnect() @websocket_instruction \"reconnect\";\n  message connection_lost() @websocket_feedback \"connection_lost\";\n  message msg1(Param : Float, ClientID : UInt16) \n            @code \"101\" //ID for serialization purposes\n            @websocket_client_id \"ClientID\";\n}\nprotocol Websocket //Configuration at Design time\n@websocket_server \"true\"\n@websocket_max_client \"16\"\n@websocket_enable_unicast \"true\"\n@serialization \"msgpack\"\n\nconfiguration myCfg {\ninstance i : myThing // The thing myThing can send\n// messages through websocket in a\nconnector i.myPort over Websocket //transparent way\n}\nThis architecture offers a trade-off between abstraction and customizability. It allows to hide or expose parts of the communication paradigm on demand, depending on what the application requires. It provides a way to extend the ThingML code generation framework for message exchanges, while relying if necessary on serialization plugins described in the following section.\nSerialization Plugins\nSerialization plugins are in charge of generating both the serialization and parsing of a set of ThingML messages. Note that serialization and parsing are not necessarily perfect mirrors, as ports can be asymmetrical. ThingML provides a default binary and string-based (JSON) serialization and deserialization, available and interoperable in C, JavaScript and Java. A number of experiment has also been conducted on a number of proprietary protocols, such as the Multiwii Serial Protocol used in some drone flight controllers.\nIn order to be flexible enough, the code generation framework must provide a way to integrate rapidly existing native library to enable the use of standard serialization schemes. But it also needs to support custom/proprietary communication protocols, by modelling their existing messages in ThingML and generating code compatible with non-modifiable software and hardware components.Moreover, to meet the various needs of compatibility, a serialization plugin needs to be usable in two different ways:\n\nIt can either be provided to a network plugin in order to generate fully executable code for the ThingML end.-\nIt can also be used to generate the methods separately in order to integrate them directly in sources written in the targeted language.\n\nThese different usages offer more flexibility on the choice of the end to adapt. One can either adapt the ThingML end of a link, but also the end running a software component written in another language. While enabling this choice, it fits the maintainability requirement as it allows regeneration of code after modification of the set of messages.\n"},"heads_methodology/thingml_test.html":{"url":"heads_methodology/thingml_test.html","title":"Test the ThingML compilers and plugins","keywords":"","body":"In order to validate code generators, the code generator testing framework provides an extensible set of tests, with currently 140 tests. Those are ThingML models of programs from which expected outputs (oracle) are provided. As much as possible those model demonstrate one specific aspect of the ThingML language. Therefore, the framework is able to test a compiler, and check that these models are indeed transformed into code that produces the expected outputs. By comparing the outputs of different compilers, it is also possible to detect possible misalignment in the semantics implemented by these different compilers. The testing framework can be simply extended by adding new test models.\nTo accelerate the execution of the test suite 140 x number of compilers, the execution of the tests is parallelized so as to use all the available core on your local PC.

This frees you from the application selection and configuration provided by the vendor and allows you to customize the device through the use of packages to suit any application. For developer, OpenWrt is the framework to build an application without having to build a complete firmware around it; for users this means the ability for full customization, to use the device in ways never envisioned.\nWe use in particular the lede project. \nThe LEDE project is a Linux-based, embedded meta-distribution based on OpenWrt, targeting a wide range of wireless SOHO routers and non-network devices.

It takes a couple of minutes to flash the router, but once it is done, the router will reboot and you should get a new IP adress 192.168.1.X and everything should be fine again.\nYou can login to the router through ssh. \nssh root@192.168.1.1\n\nYou can connect to the luci interface here login, admin no passwword.\nExtend the filesystem on a USB key.\nFirst thing you have to do is to extend the File system.

is the director of a Kevoree runtime:\n\nit is in charge of a node (Kevoree NodeType)\nit has to execute adaptations on deployments (model@run.time)\nkeeps track of model changes\n\nBootstrap\nThe first step of the core is to bootstrap the runtime. To do so, the core is in charge\nof creating the node instance defined with a unique name at the start of the Core.In order to know which NodeType to instantiate and with what properties, the core must have a model containing those data.This model is known as the bootstrap model. Using this model the core will be able to\ncreate a new ContainerNode instance and keep a reference to it in order to ask that particular node how to do runtime adaptations on deployment phases.\nDeployment phase\nUsing pseudo-code, the deployment algorithm (model@run.time) looks like this:\nfun deployNewModel(newModel: KevModel) {\n    // check the validity of the new model\n    if (isValid(newModel)) {\n        // compare new model with current model\n        const compareResult: AdaptationModel = node.compare(currentModel, newModel);\n        // execute a list of command to adapt the current system\n        // according to the new model\n        if (compareResult.execute()) {\n            // keep track of current model (history)\n            saveModel(currentModel);\n            // use new model as current model\n            setCurrentModel(newModel);\n        } else {\n            // if an adaptation fails, rollback to previous state\n            // which means, execute the successfully applied command\n            // backwards to go back to the previous state\n            compareResult.rollback();\n            // notify error\n            throw error;\n        }\n    } else {\n        // if the new model is not a valid model, discard it and notify\n        throw error;\n    }\n}\n\nError handling\nIf an error occurs while processing the adaptations the Core is in charge of putting the runtime state back to the previous one. This is known as the rollback phase.A rollback is an execution of all the already processed adaptations but backwards (cf. Deployment phase algorithm)\nUsing the Core within the running components and fragments\nFrom a component or fragment perspective, one might want to apply reconfigurations on the running system on its own. To do so, each Component, Channel, Group and Node must be able to get a reference to the runtime core.  \nIn Java, accessing the runtime core can be done like that:\n@Component(version = 1)\npublic class MyComponent {\n\n    @KevoreeInject\n    private ModelService modelService;\n\n    public void doSomethingWithCore() {\n        modelService.update(aModel, new UpdateCallback() {\n            @Override\n            public void run(Boolean success) {\n                if (success) {\n                    // adaptations made\n                } else {\n                    // problem with adaptation: not done\n                }\n            }\n        });\n    }\n}\n\nIn JavaScript, each instance can access the core locally:\nconst AbstractComponent = require('kevoree-entities/lib/AbstractComponent');\n\nmodule.export = AbstractComponent.extend({\n    toString: 'MyComponent',\n        tdef_version: 1,\n\n    doSomethingWithCore: function () {\n        this.getKevoreeCore().deploy(aModel, function (err) {\n            if (err) {\n                // problem with adaptation: not done\n            } else {\n                // adaptations made\n            }\n        });\n    }\n});\n\n"},"heads_methodology/kevoree-platform-integration/remote_code_loader.html":{"url":"heads_methodology/kevoree-platform-integration/remote_code_loader.html","title":"Remote Code Loader","keywords":"","body":"Remote code loader\nIntroduction\nA Kevoree model represents a set of Components, Nodes, Groups and Channels that can be connected together.\nAt some point the nodes have to load the Components, Groups fragments and Channels fragments from a shared code repository.\nOnce loaded in a node, a piece of code must be isolated from the rest of the application.\nFor example if a Node \"A\" have a dependency to a library Z in version 1.0.0 and have to load Component \"B\" with a dependency to the same library Z but in version 2.0.0, the action of loading \"B\" in the context of \"A\" should not override Z in its version 2.0.0\nExisting implementations\nJava\nRepo: mavenLoader: ClassLoader named KCL\nJavascript\nRepo: npmLoader: Node.js module (CommonJS standard)\nCode isolation is a structural feature of this platform because modules are loaded based on their full path location and versioning is handled by npm\nC#\nRepo: NugetLoader:\nThe code isolation is based on AppDomain and the MEF Framework.  \nThe Kevoree Dotnet Nuget Loader is a component which combines Nuget, AppDomain and MEF.

However, instead of a simple p.send it is possible to use third-party APIs, for example publishing a message on a MQTT topic.\nThe channel context gives you access to the model. The dispatch method is called automatically when a message is received by one of the channel fragment. You must have in mind that this channel is instantiated for any node on which bound components are deployed.\nYou can follow this tutorial on how to make your own Kevoree channel for more details about channels.\n"},"heads_methodology/cep_platform_experts.html":{"url":"heads_methodology/cep_platform_experts.html","title":"Using platforms for CEP with Apama","keywords":"","body":"Platform Experts for CEP\nIn order to deploy code generated from ThingML CEP on Apama CEP engines, we need to have Apama EPL as a supported platform in the HEADS transformation framework.\nA platform expert with Apama CEP knowledge is needed for writing a plug-in for this HEADS transformation framework in order to support Apama EPL as a target platform.\nThis plug-in transforms ThingML CEP into Apama EPL code.

A state machine-based programming language, and ThingML in particular, is thus a good candidate to implement Kevoree components and write the logic that orchestrates the different ports of this component.\nDefine interfaces:\nLet's consider a simple ThingML program made of two things, basically involving message to deal with a timer:\nthing fragment TimerMsgs {\n    // Start the Timer\n    message timer_start(delay : Integer);\n    // Cancel the Timer\n    message timer_cancel();\n    // Notification that the timer has expired\n    message timer_timeout();\n}\nFirst, a timer:\nthing fragment Timer includes TimerMsgs\n{\n    provided port timer\n    {\n        sends timer_timeout\n        receives timer_start, timer_cancel\n    }\n}\nImplement the logic using state machines and action languages\nA simple client using the timer could be:\nthing HelloTimer includes TimerMsgs {\n\n    required port timer {\n        receives timer_timeout\n        sends timer_start, timer_cancel\n    }\n\n    readonly property period : Integer = 1000\n    property counter : Integer = 0\n\n    statechart behavior init Init {\n\n        state Init {\n            on entry do\n                timer!timer_start(period)\n            end\n\n            transition -> Init //this will loop on the Init state, and start a new timer\n            event timer?timer_timeout\n            action do\n                        print \"hello \"\n                print counter\n                        print \"\\n\"\n                        counter = counter + 1\n            end\n        }\n    }\n}\nThis simple, platform-independent service basically outputs a \"hello n\" every second. This is realized by starting a timer when entering the Init state. On timeout, a timer_timeout message is received, triggering the prints, before it re-enters the Init state.\nBasically, this would produce the following outputs:\nhello 0\nhello 1\nhello 2\nAlternatively, the previous example can be refactored in the following way to keep the state machine clean:\nthing HelloTimer includes TimerMsgs {\n\n    required port timer {\n        receives timer_timeout\n        sends timer_start, timer_cancel\n    }\n\n    readonly property period : Integer = 1000\n    property counter : Integer = 0\n\n    function printHello() do\n        print \"hello \"\n    print counter\n        print \"\\n\"\n        counter = counter + 1\n    end\n\n    statechart behavior init Init {\n\n        state Init {\n        on entry do\n            timer!timer_start(period)\n        end\n\n        transition -> Init //this will loop on the Init state, and start a new timer\n        event timer?timer_timeout\n        action printHello()\n    }\n    }\n}\nMore generally the general syntax for a function is:\nfunction myFunction(param1 : ParamType1, param2 : ParamType2) : ReturnType do\n    ...\nend\nLike in most programming languages, functions are particularly useful to encapsulate code that is called from multiple places, to avoid duplication.\n\nThe HEADS action and expression language is fairly aligned with major programming languages such as Java, JavaScript or C: \n\nvariable definitions and affectations var i : Integer = 0,\nalgebraic (+, -, etc) and boolean operators (and and or)\ncontrol structures if (true) do ... end else do ... end, while(true) do ... end\nprint \"hello\" and error \"alert!\"\nfunction calls myFunction(0, 1)\n\nIn addition to the \"normal\" statements common with those language, HEADS provides:\n\nsend a message myPort!myMessage(), myPort!myMessage2(a, b, 0) for asynchronous message passing between components\n\n\nImplement advanced logic with Complex Event Processing\nThe HEADS modelling language has been extended with CEP concepts (See D2.2 for more details). CEP complements state machines and provides more powerful abstractions to handle streams of events, for example to compute the average of the values provided by a sensor on a given time window, or to when some behavior should be triggered when two events happen \"at the same time\". While this can be expressed with state machines, this typically implies instantiating timers and arrays (to manage time windows), managing different interleaving, etc, i.e. this generates accidental complexity. Those CEP concepts are mapped to the ones provided by ReactiveX.\nJoin\nThe join operator \"combines items emitted by two Observables whenever an item from one Observable is emitted during a time window defined according to an item emitted by the other Observable\". See the figure below (taken from ReactiveX documentation) to get an idea of how it works.\n\nThis is expressed in the HEADS modelling language using this syntax:\nstream simpleJoinWithParams @TTL \"100\" do\n    from [e1 : receivePort?m1 & e2 : receivePort?m2 -> cep1(e1.v1 + e2.v1)]\n    select a : #0, b : #1\n    action sendPort!cep1(a, b)\nend\nWhenever a message m1 and a message m2 are received within 100 ms, it will produce a cep1 message.\nThe same query expressed directly using the ReactiveX API would require about 15 lines of code (in Java or here in JavaScript):\n//Code sample taken from ReactiveX documentation\nvar xs = Rx.Observable.interval(100)\n    .map(function (x) { return 'first' + x; });\n\nvar ys = Rx.Observable.interval(100)\n    .map(function (x) { return 'second' + x; });\n\nvar source = xs\n    .join(\n        ys,\n        function () { return Rx.Observable.timer(0); },\n        function () { return Rx.Observable.timer(0); },\n        function (x, y) { return x + y; }\n    )\n    .take(5);\n\nvar subscription = source.subscribe(\n    function (x) { console.log('Next: ' + x); },\n    function (err) { console.log('Error: ' + err); },\n    function () { console.log('Completed'); });\n\nThe declarative syntax of the HEADS modelling language for CEP concepts hence greatly simplifies the expression of CEP queries. Moreover, the stream expressed above can be compiled to Java or JavaScript with no modification, the compiler taking care of mapping to the Java and JS version of the ReactiveX APIs.\nMerge\nThe Merge operator \"combine multiple Observables into one by merging their emissions\". See the figure below (taken from ReactiveX documentation) to get an idea of how it works.\n\nThis is expressed in the HEADS modelling language using this syntax:\nstream simpleMerge do\n    from [e1 : receivePort?m1 | e2 : receivePort?m2 -> cep1()]\n    action sendPort!cep1()\nend\nThe same query expressed directly using the ReactiveX API would require about 15 lines of code (in JavaScript or here in Java):\n//Code sample taken from ReactiveX documentation\nObservable odds = Observable.just(1, 3, 5).subscribeOn(someScheduler);\nObservable evens = Observable.just(2, 4, 6);\n\nObservable.merge(odds, evens)\n          .subscribe(new Subscriber() {\n        @Override\n        public void onNext(Integer item) {\n            System.out.println(\"Next: \" + item);\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void onError(Throwable error) {\n            System.err.println(\"Error: \" + error.getMessage());\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void onCompleted() {\n            System.out.println(\"Sequence complete.\");\n        }\n    });\n\nFilter\nA Filter \"emits only those items from an Observable that pass a predicate test\". See the figure below (taken from ReactiveX documentation) to get an idea of how it works.\n\nThis is expressed in the HEADS modelling language using this syntax:\noperator lessThan4(m : m1) : Boolean \n    return m.x  res(e1.x)]::filter(lessThan4(m))\n        select a : #0\n        action send!res(a)\n    end\nThe same query expressed directly using the ReactiveX API would require about 15 lines of code (in JavaScript or here in Java):\n//Code sample taken from ReactiveX documentation\nObservable.just(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n          .filter(new Func1() {\n              @Override\n              public Boolean call(Integer item) {\n                return( item () {\n        @Override\n        public void onNext(Integer item) {\n            System.out.println(\"Next: \" + item);\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void onError(Throwable error) {\n            System.err.println(\"Error: \" + error.getMessage());\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void onCompleted() {\n            System.out.println(\"Sequence complete.\");\n        }\n    });\n\nAggregator and Windows\nA Window (or Buffer) \"periodically gathers items emitted by an Observable into bundles and emit these bundles rather than emitting the items one at a time\". See the figure below (taken from ReactiveX documentation) to get an idea of how it works.\n\nThis is expressed in the HEADS modelling language using this syntax:\nstream lengthW do // compute min, max, average of m2.x on windows of 5 seconds\n    from e : [recv?m2]::timeWindow(5000, 5000)\n    select avg : average(e.x[]), min : min(e.x[]), max : max(e.x[])\n    action send!res2(avg, min, max)\nend\nAggregators are normal functions that takes arrays (corresponding to the content of a window/buffer) as parameter:\nfunction average(x : Integer[]) : Float do\n    var i : Integer = 0\n    var sum : Integer = 0\n    while (i Those aggregators are typically defined in a reusable libraries that any stream can then use directly.\nDebugging\nTraces are a common way of understanding the execution of a program, identify and solve bugs. Traces can automatically be added to trace:\n\nthe initialization of instances, with values for all attributes. Those traces appear in light blue in the figure below.\nthe execution of the state machine (which states are being entered/exited, which transition are triggered, etc). Those traces appear in yellow in the figure below.\nthe emission/reception of messages on ports. Those traces appear in green in the figure below.\nthe affectation of variables. Those traces appear in magenta/purple in the figure below.\nthe execution of functions. Those traces appear in dark blue (not present in the figure below).\n\nUsing @debug \"true\" and @debug \"false\" the service developer can finely filter the elements he wants to trace.\n\n"},"heads_methodology/compile_thingml_components_to_platform_specific_code.html":{"url":"heads_methodology/compile_thingml_components_to_platform_specific_code.html","title":"Compile ThingML components to platform specific code","keywords":"","body":"Compile ThingML components to platform specific code\nIn order to produce executable code, a ThingML configuration should be defined, where components (both platform-independent and platform-specific) need to be instantiated and connected togather:\nconfiguration TestTimerJava {\n    instance timer : TimerJava\n    instance client : TimerClientJava\n    connector client.timer => timer.timer\n}\nTest your things in a standalone mode\nThis ThingML program can then be compiled (using the standalone editor) to Java.

Then the service developer can generate Apama EPL code for things modeled in ThingML.\nA second approach is to develop a service using Apama EPL and create the service as one query. In a second step use the CEP Recommender (described in deliverable D4.3 of the HEADS project).\nJoin and Filter\nThis example joins two streams (equi-join). Each of these is filtered with a condition. The example demonstrates two aspects. First, filter operations and join operations can be executed on different CEP engines.

This How To describes the preferred components to use inside the HEADS IDE.\nComponents of Apama Studio\n\nDeveloping EPL with Apama Studio: EPL Editor\n\nTo get started with EPL inside the Apama Studio use the tutorial on EPL monitor scripts. In Apama Studio open the Welcome page, go to the Tutorials section. There are three tutorials. The last one with the title 'Developing an Application with MonitorScript' is the most important one. It explains the Apama Event Programming Language (EPL), called \"MonitorScript\". A Cheat Sheet guides you through this tutorial. \nIn addition there are several samples introducing topics of Apama. In Apama Studio open the Welcome page, go to the Samples section. These six samples can be imported into an Eclipse workspace as Apama projects. From the Apama Workbench perspective you can launch these samples, one at a time. The Readme files suggest small exercises to modify these samples. The source of the samples is the folder 'demos' in the Apama installation. The folder 'samples' contains more in-depth examples for components of Apama and the connection with other products like Universal Messaging or Terracotta BigMemory.\nSteps to perform for a sample:\n\nImport project into workspace\nExplore files in the Apama Workbench perspective. Toggle on the 'Show All Folders' button in the toolbar of the 'Workbench Project View'.\nLaunch the sample with the 'Launch Control Panel'. This starts a correlator (Apama CEP runtime process) listening on port localhost:15903 (default). \nIn addition a dashboard viewer is started in a separate window and events are sent to the correlator. \n\nThere are three perspectives in Apama Studio, Apama Developer, Apama Runtime, and Apama Workbench. Apama Developer is similar to the Java perspective in JDT. Apama Workbench is a simplified combination of Apama Developer and Apama Runtime. It is tailored to work on a single Apama project. This can be selected in the Workbench Project View.\n\nUsing the Query Builder in Apama Studio\n\nThe Query Builder is a combined graphical and textual editor for Apama Queries. These queries are new with Apama 5.3 and they allow a purely descriptive way to define stream queries. These queries are capable of large time windows.\n\nEvent Modeler\n\nThis component helps to model state machines in EPL. This is not the focus inside the HEADS IDE and therefore not described in detail. Refer to the Apama documentation which is included in the Eclipse Help.  \n\nDashboard Builder\n\nThe dashboard builder is used for the development of dashboard to visualize stream data. This is not part of the HEADS IDE and not in the focus of HEADS.  \nHow to use the CEP Recommender\nSuppose a service developer implements an EPL query. This query can be partitioned into parts which define new streams of events which are filtered, joined, projected and otherwise transformed. The parts of the query can run on other nodes than one central CEP node which runs on a powerful machine. With the help of platform experts the service developer can run the CEP Recommender to get a recommendation for a set of EPL queries which run on several nodes according to their CEP capabilities. The platform experts have to describe the CEP capabilities of the nodes, the CPU capacities. In addition the service developer has to describe the CPU capacity consumption of the operations in the query and the event rates on the input streams and the selectivity of filter operations.\nWith this information the CEP Recommender calculates recommended partitions with model transformations through Triple Graph Grammars. The algorithmically steps are \n\nBuild the syntax model, a kind of an abstract syntax tree from the EPL syntax.\nBuild the Query Operator Tree with Xtend from the syntax model.\nTransform the Query Operator Tree with eMoflon using Triple Graph Grammars into the Meta Model. The Meta Model adds information for the partitioning to the Query Operator Tree.\nTransform the Meta Model with eMoflon using Triple Graph Grammars into a partitioning of the query. This partitioning is one of a list of partitionings since the Tripple Graph Grammar transformation is not unique. \nThe result of this algorithm is a list of recommendations, each partitioning the original query into a set of simpler queries. The user has to decide, which partitioning fits best.\nEach partitioning is a model instance, containing a partitioned query, i.e. a set of simpler queries which have together the same functionality than the input query. Such a set of queries can be deployed to the nodes. \n\nThis approach is also described in deliverable D4.2, section 4.2.\nThe steps for the different roles in the HEADS IDE are:\n\nThe service developer develops query logic (EPL text, Apama query language is not implemented yet). This is the main input, which is put into a text file with the extension epl.\nThe service developer starts with the context menu of this file, entry CEP Recommender, the algorithm. The result is the Meta Model, which is visible in the Meta Data Editor.\nIn this editor, the service developer adds statistical data: event rates, event sizes, selectivity of filters, etc.\nIn the same editor the platform expert provides nodes info: CPU capacity of the nodes and CEP capabilities of the nodes.\nWhen all the input is collected the service developer or the platform expert starts the generation of the recommendations with the same context menu on the epl file. The recommendations are in a folder besides the epl file.\n\nThe service developer or the platform expert has to decide which recommendation fits best to be deployed on the distributed nodes.  \n\nFuture developments for the rest of the project\n\nThe CEP Recommender should also work on the Apama query language, which is a feature first included in Apama 5.3.

They had so much impact that v5.4.x is no longer backward-compatible with v5.3.x and below.  \nKevoree Registry: users & namespaces\nIn order to give more control over what is published on the registry, we have added users and namespaces to it.This means that from now on, valid credentials are mandatory to publish models to the registry. To get those credentials, an account has to be created on the registry,  here.Creating a new user will automatically create a namespace with the same name so you can directly publish Kevoree models using those credentials.But it also allows you to create new namespaces (if not already created), from the registry website using the New namespace button when authenticated.  \nOne configuration file for all platforms\nThe Kevoree registry connection information and user crendentials can now be stored independently from the Kevoree platform you are using.\nIt has to be located in $HOME/.kevoree in a JSON file named config.json:\n{\n  \"user\": {\n    \"login\": \"YOUR_NAME_HERE\",\n    \"password\": \"YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE\"\n  },\n  \"registry\": {\n    \"host\": \"registry.kevoree.org\",\n    \"port\": 443,\n    \"ssl\": true,\n    \"oauth\": {\n      \"client_secret\": \"kevoree_registryapp_secret\",\n      \"client_id\": \"kevoree_registryapp\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nFor security reasons, this file should have limited read access on your operating system\n\nThis file will be read by the KevScript interpreter in order to connect to the registry and resolve TypeDefinitions & DeployUnits.If you want to connect to a third-party registry, just modify the content of the $HOME/.kevoree/config.json file according to your registry location and credentials.  \nThe new KevScript resolver\nWe have introduced two new keywords in the language in order to solve DeployUnit resolutions by the KevScript interpreter:\n\nLATEST\nRELEASE  \n\nTypeDefinition versions can now be specified using whether an integer or LATEST which will indicate to the KevScript interpret which version the service developers expect. For the DeployUnits, the possibilities are whether LATEST or RELEASE. Refer to the table at the end of this wiki page for more details about those keywords.\nPlatform specific details\nYou can read more about the migration for a specific platform here:\n\nJava platform migration\nJavaScript platform migration\n\n"},"heads_methodology/for_service_operators.html":{"url":"heads_methodology/for_service_operators.html","title":"For Service Operators","keywords":"","body":"For Service Operators\n"},"heads_methodology/visualize_the_configuration_and_status_of_a_running_hd-service.html":{"url":"heads_methodology/visualize_the_configuration_and_status_of_a_running_hd-service.html","title":"Visualize the configuration and status of a running HD-Service","keywords":"","body":"Visualize the configuration and status of a running HD-Service\nPlease follow the tutorials\nhttp://kevoree.org/practices/level0\nand\nhttps://github.com/kevoree/kevoree-eclipse-plugin/\n\ntodo Inria to complete this part\n\n"},"heads_methodology/modify_the_configuration_and_deployment_of_a_running_hd-service.html":{"url":"heads_methodology/modify_the_configuration_and_deployment_of_a_running_hd-service.html","title":"Modify the configuration and deployment of a running HD-Service","keywords":"","body":"Modify the configuration and deployment of a running HD-Service\nhttp://kevoree.org/practices/level2\nhttp://kevoree.org/practices/level3\n\ntodo Inria to complete this part\n\n"},"heads_methodology/re-deployadaptreconfigure_a_running_hd-service.html":{"url":"heads_methodology/re-deployadaptreconfigure_a_running_hd-service.html","title":"Re-deploy/adapt/reconfigure a running HD-Service","keywords":"","body":"Re-deploy/adapt/reconfigure a running HD-Service\nIn order to reconfigure a Kevoree model and trigger adaptations of your system after re-deployment you need a\n Kevoree Editor (Java Editor\nor Web Editor) and some knowledge of the Kevoree Script (KevScript) language.\nUsing the Web Editor\n\nYou need to have a group providing a WebSocket endpoint in order to pull/push your models with the Kevoree Web Editor\n (i.e WSGroup - Java platform or WebSocketGroup - JavaScript platform)  \n\nPulling your model\nOpen a Web browser to this location: http://editor.kevoree.org/?host=SOME_HOST&port=SOME_PORTThis will automatically pull the model using WebSocket and the host:port you specified in the URL parameters.Now you should have your model displayed in the editor.  \n\nReconfigure your model\nUsing KevScript\nIf you open the KevScript editor (using the button in the top panel) the content is updated to reflect your current\nmodel content.You can edit this KevScript directly and then press Run so that it modifies your model.Once you are done reconfiguring your model you are going to want to deploy it.
