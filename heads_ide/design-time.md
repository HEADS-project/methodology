# @Design-time

At design-time, HEADS IDE will provide the different HEADS actors with modelling languages, editors and tools to engineer HD-services.

[ThingML](http://thingml.org) is as a domain-specific modeling language which includes concepts to describe both software components and communication protocols. The formalism used is a combination of architecture models, state machines and an imperative action language similar to concepts found e.g. in UML2. ThingML also provides a set of compilers (currently targeting C and Java-based platforms) in order to produce fully executable code from ThingML specifications. ThingML will both support the platform experts and service developers to define (respectively) drivers and business logic.
