# @Runtime

> **todo** Inria to complete this part

At runtime, the HEADS platform will be composed of a set of components and protocols supporting the execution of HD-services.

The CEP execution engine is responsible for the execution of EPL components together with adapters for conversion of external data.

The communications among HEADS components will largely rely on MQTT.  

### What is Kevoree
Adaptive systems are complex! Even more when they are distributed!  
The Models@Run.time strategy adopted by Kevoree aims at offering a clean, safer and simpler way to interact with distributed systems. Using models first, Kevoree allows users to define complex adaptations easily, to build for instance self-healing systems. Extensible, this project already offers runtime for JVM, Android, Arduino and Javascript, but also for virtualization management such as VirtualBox. In short, Kevoree is helping you to develop your heterogeneous, distributed and adaptive software from Cloud stacks to embedded devices!

Build around a component model, Kevoree leverages the model@runtime paradigm to offer tools to build, adapt and synchronize distributed systems.
