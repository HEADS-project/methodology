At runtime, the HEADS platform will be composed of a set of components and protocols supporting the execution of HD-services.

The CEP execution engine is responsible for the execution of EPL components together with adapters for conversion of external data.

The communication between two components can be performed over different channel types. HEADS IDE provides support for the following communication protocols: serial communication (RS232 and RS485), ZWave, ZigBee, OPC and MQTT. However, Platform Experts may extend the functionality and improve usability of the system by providing new communication plug-ins which will be used by Service Operator during development and configuration of the HD-Services.
